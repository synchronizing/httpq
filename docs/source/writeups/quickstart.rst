Quickstart
##########

`httpq` is a module to parse, modify, and compile HTTP/1.1 messages with a simple built-in state machine. It was build from the ground up with the intention of being quick, simple, and easy to use.

Installing
----------

.. code-block::

    pip install httpq

Using
-----

`httpq` has three methods to initialize a `httpq.Request` and `httpq.Response` object.

:py:meth:`httpq.httpq.Message.__init__`
***************************************

Easily initialize an HTTP message.

.. code-block:: python

    import httpq

    req = httpq.Request(
        method="GET",
        target="/get",
        protocol="HTTP/1.1",
        headers={"Host": "httpbin.org", "Content-Length": 12},
        body="Hello world!",
    )

    resp = httpq.Response(
        protocol="HTTP/1.1",
        status=200,
        reason="OK",
        headers={"Content-Length": 12},
        body="Hello world!",
    )
    

:py:meth:`httpq.httpq.Message.parse`
************************************

Parses an entire raw HTTP message.

.. code-block:: python

    req = httpq.Request.parse(
        "GET /get HTTP/1.1\r\n"
        "Host: httpbin.org\r\n"
        "Content-Length: 12\r\n"
        "\r\n"
        "Hello world!"
    )

    resp = httpq.Response.parse(
        "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
        "Content-Length: 12\r\n"
        "\r\n"
        "Hello world!"
    )

:py:meth:`httpq.httpq.Message.feed`
***************************************

Parse chunks of a raw HTTP message.

.. code-block:: python

    req = httpq.Request()
    req.feed("GET /get HTTP/1.1\r\n")
    req.feed("Host: httpbin.org\r\n")
    req.feed("Content-Length: 18\r\n")
    req.feed("\r\n")
    req.feed("Hello world!")

    resp = httpq.Response()
    resp.feed("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n")
    resp.feed("Content-Length: 12\r\n")
    resp.feed("\r\n")
    resp.feed("Hello world!") 

The feed mechanism, different from the other two methods of initializing a message, is intended to be used with the built-in state machine. 

When parsing a message from a stream the state machine keeps track of *where* in the message the parser is. This allows more advance parsing and mechanism to be built.

.. code-block:: python

    import socket
    import httpq

    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect(("httpbin.org", 80))

    req = httpq.Request(
        method="GET",
        target="/get",
        protocol="HTTP/1.1",
        headers={"Host": "httpbin.org"},
    )
    s.sendall(req.raw)

    resp = httpq.Response()
    while resp.step_state() != httpq.state.BODY:
        resp.feed(s.recv(10))

    body = resp.body
    while len(body) != resp.headers["Content-Length"]:
        body += s.recv(10)

Note that the feed mechanism is used in conjunction with the `step_state` method. This allows the state machine to be stepped through and the parser to be advanced. We can use this parse until the body of the message, and then use the captured headers to parse the body.

Modifying and Comparisons
*************************

``httpq`` also comes, out-of-the-box, with an intuitive method to modify and compare message values without caring about type:

.. code-block:: python

    import httpq

    req = httpq.Request(
        method="GET",
        target="/get",
        protocol="HTTP/1.1",
        headers={"Host": "httpbin.org", "Content-Length": 12},
        body="Hello world!",
    )

    resp = httpq.Response(
        protocol="HTTP/1.1",
        status=404,
        reason="Not Found",
        headers={"Content-Length": 12},
        body="Hello world!",
    )

    # string, bytes, and int are all valid values for any field.
    req.method = "POST"
    req.target = b"/"

    resp.status = 200
    resp.reason = "OK"
    resp.headers += {"Accept": "*/*"}

Internally every value of a request or response is saved as an `Item`, a special object type that allows easy setting and comparisons on the fly.

.. code-block::

    resp.status == 200      # >>> True
    resp.status == "200"    # >>> True
    resp.status == b"200"   # >>> True

Once the object is modified to the user's preference utilizing the :py:class:`Request` and :py:class:`Response` object is as easy as calling a property (specifically ``.raw``):

.. code-block:: python

    print(req.raw)
    print(resp.raw)

.. code-block:: 

    b'POST / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: httpbin.org\r\nContent-Length: 12\r\n\r\nHello world!'
    b'HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 12\r\nAccept: */*\r\n\r\nHello world!'

Uniquely, the :py:meth:`Message.__str__` method returns the objects with arrows to make obvious of its type:

.. code-block:: python

    print(req)
    print(resp)

.. code-block::

    → POST / HTTP/1.1
    → Host: httpbin.org
    → Content-Length: 12
    → 
    → Hello world!

    ← HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    ← Content-Length: 12
    ← Accept: */*
    ← 
    ← Hello world!

Questions & Answers
-------------------

.. _h11: https://github.com/python-hyper/h11
.. |h11| replace:: **h11** 

.. _http-parser: https://github.com/benoitc/http-parser
.. |http-parser| replace:: **http-parser** 

.. _httptools: https://github.com/MagicStack/httptools
.. |httptools| replace:: **httptools** 

**How does this project differ from** |h11|_ **,** |http-parser|_ **, or** |httptools|_ **?**

The intention of this project is to be a simple to use http parser that allows common-sense getting and setting of HTTP values within a message. It is not intended to be a complete implementation of the HTTP protocol like h11, or be a call-back style parser like http-parser and httptools.

**Why another HTTP parser?**

Because while there are many HTTP parsers out in the wild there were none that I thought were intuitive and easy to use. This project is a ~300 line Python module with a simple API and implementation.

It's also intended for the `mitm <https://github.com/synchronizing/mitm>`_ and `night <https://github.com/synchronizing/night>`_ project, and I figured it would be best to have my own implementation to make it easier to manage and maintain.
